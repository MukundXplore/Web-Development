# Repository: JavaScript Implementations for Web Development 
(Integrated Dual Degree BTech-MTech, CSE - Semester 2)

This repository documents the collection of JavaScript implementations developed as part of the Web Development course (IDD, CSE) during the second semester. The artefacts herein demonstrate the application of client-side scripting principles to enhance the interactivity and dynamic behaviour of web interfaces, built upon foundational HTML and CSS structures.

## Introduction

This repository is a curated portfolio of JavaScript code exercises and projects undertaken throughout the specified academic period. The primary objective of these implementations was to solidify understanding and practical application of core JavaScript concepts relevant to front-end web development. The included projects illustrate proficiency in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), managing event-driven interactions, implementing client-side validation mechanisms, and employing asynchronous programming paradigms where applicable.

The scope of the projects encompasses a range of fundamental JavaScript functionalities, including but not limited to:

* **DOM Manipulation:** Programmatic alteration of HTML document structure, style, and content.
* **Event Handling:** Implementation of event listeners to respond to user-initiated actions and system events.
* **Form Validation:** Client-side scripting to ensure data integrity and provide immediate feedback to users.
* **Algorithmic Implementation:** Development of basic algorithms and logical constructs using JavaScript syntax and control flow.
* **Interactive UI Components:** Creation of dynamic user interface elements such as image carousels, navigation menus, and content toggles.

## Technical Specifications

* **HTML:** Utilised for the semantic structuring of web document content.
* **CSS:** Employed for the declarative styling and visual presentation of web interfaces.
* **JavaScript:** The primary scripting language used for client-side dynamic functionality and interactivity.

## Conclusion

This repository contains my client-side JavaScript projects from the Web Development course (Semester 2). These demonstrate foundational front-end scripting. The dynamic aspects explored here have ignited my interest in server-side technologies, which I plan to learn later.
I look forward to exploring the full scope of web development.
